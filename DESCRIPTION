Description: A set of tools for likelihood-based estimation, model selection and testing of two- and three-range shift and migration models for animal movement data as described in Gurarie et al. (2017) <doi: 10.1111/1365-2656.12674>.  Provided movement data (X, Y and Time), including irregularly sampled data, functions estimate the time, duration and location of one or two range shifts, as well as the ranging area and auto-correlation structure of the movment.  Tests assess, for example, whether the shift was "significant", and whether a two-shift migration was a true return migration.
